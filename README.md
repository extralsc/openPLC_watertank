# üíß Water Tank Smart Supervisor ‚Äî SCS600 ht 2025

This project adds an intelligent supervisory layer and secure logging system to an OpenPLC-based water tank.  
The Python script acts as the on-call engineer‚Äôs HMI, automating daily operation and collecting clean evidence of safe behavior.

## üß© Project Overview

- **OpenPLC program:** `WaterTankPump.st`  
  Provides local, safe control logic for the pump (latching start/stop and emergency stop).
- **Python supervisor:** `tank_supervisor.py`  
  Simulates a ‚Äúday,‚Äù automatically starts/stops the pump, logs key events, and ensures safety.
- **Log analyzer:** `summarize_log.py`  
  Reads the log and summarizes pump cycles, safety trips, and overall behavior.
- **Security hardening:** firewall + multi-factor SSH login on the desktop/HMI.

After one simulated ‚Äúday,‚Äù you can open the summary and answer:

> ‚ÄúDid the pump behave as expected?‚Äù

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

| Component | Role | Location |
|------------|------|----------|
| OpenPLC (`WaterTankPump.st`) | Executes pump control & safety interlocks | PLC or OpenPLC Runtime |
| Python Supervisor (`tank_supervisor.py`) | Supervises operation, simulates drain profile, logs events | Desktop / HMI |
| Log Summary (`summarize_log.py`) | Produces readable daily report | Desktop / HMI |
| Firewall + MFA SSH | Protects desktop access | Desktop |
